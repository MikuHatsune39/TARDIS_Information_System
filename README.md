# TARDIS Information System
An attempt to write a copy of The TARDIS Information system. <br/>

Please Note: <br/>
This program uses the linux command "clear", if you are using windows please replace "clear" with "cls". <br/>
You will also likely have to change "./db/" to ".\\\\db\\\\". <br/>
To convert the files place the files from the Scripts folder in the same folder as "main.c" and run "Convert2Windows.bat" <br/>
(You can also delete "main" and "main.o" as thoes are for the linux build and a windows version will be made when you compile "main.c")
